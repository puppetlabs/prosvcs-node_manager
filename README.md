# This repository is deprecated

This module is based on the `puppetclassify` gem and is deprecated, though the 
repository will continue to be hosted on Github with the master branch intact. 
New `node_manager` module development which is based on an `https` provider has 
moved to [this repository](https://github.com/WhatsARanjit/prosvcs-node_manager), 
and the module may be downloaded from 
[WhatsARanjit/node_manager](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/WhatsARanjit/node_manager) 
on the Puppet Forge.
